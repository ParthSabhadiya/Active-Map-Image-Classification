# Active-Map-Image-Classification
Implemented Convolution Neural Network-based models(3 models) to optimization in image classification uses the class- specific gradient information flowing into the final convolutional layer of a CNN to produce a coarse localization map of the essential regions in the image Developed Grad-CAM and Guided Grad-CAM visual explanations to understand better image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models. In these models, the user just needs to upload an image and ask any question about that image, the model will highlight that part. From this method, we are able to make identical predictions about ideas without re-training the model.
